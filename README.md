# Machine-Learning Model for Multi-Label Sentiment Analysis In Tweets
Final Project for EECS4404 Introduction To Machine Learning And Pattern Recognition.

This project focuses on developing a machine-learning model for multi-label sentiment analysis in tweets from Twitter, targeting the six basic human emotions defined by Paul Ekman, which are sadness, happiness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust. The objective is to build a classifier that accurately predicts the emotions associated with a given tweet. 

The main methodology used is Naive Bayes, with a neural network as a comparative approach.

The model achieved high accuracy and F-1-score on the test data, indicating its potential for practical use in predicting sentiment in social media. It can be applied to various applications such as sentiment analysis for marketing purposes.
